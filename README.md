# MLP-from-scratch
This is a Multi Layer Perceptron project where we built it from scratch using numpy and pandas to build Back Propagation algorithm and Forward propagation.
Please make sure that this project to only be a reference to build a new one but do not copy the exact same code. Thank you.
